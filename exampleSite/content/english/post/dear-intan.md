##### A Love Story Rooted in Friendship

Hey there, dear readers! Today, I want to share a special story - the story of my love for the incredible Intan Ayu. It's a tale that started two years ago, but it wasn't until Ramadan this year that my love truly blossomed. So, i tell her that i want to make commitment and relationship with her.

##### The Meeting: Two Years Ago

Our story begins three years ago when I first had the privilege of meeting Ayu. We crossed paths through dating apps, and I remember being instantly captivated by her charm and grace. Little did I know that this chance encounter would be the start of something truly beautiful.

##### The Friendship: Building a Connection

Over those two years, Intan and I built a strong foundation of friendship. We shared laughter, dreams, and countless conversations that made us feel like we'd known each other forever. It was during this time that I discovered Intan Ayu's incredible kindness, her love for life, and her unwavering support.

##### Ramadan: The Turning Point

Then came last Ramadan, a month filled with spirituality and reflection. It was during this sacred time that our connection took a beautiful turn. It was as if Ramadan had bestowed its blessings upon our relationship.

##### The Commitment: From My Heart to Hers

As our bond grew stronger, I realized that Intan was not just someone special but the person I wanted to share my life with. So, one memorable evening during Ramadan, I decided to pour my heart out and express my deep commitment to her.

With sincerity and love, I hope to marry her, to build a future together, and to cherish every moment as a couple. The look of joy and love in her eyes was all the confirmation I needed - our hearts were in sync, and our journey together had officially begun.

##### The Future: A Promise of Forever

We are committed to nurturing our love, supporting each other's dreams, and growing together in every way.

##### In Conclusion: A Love Worth Celebrating

Our love story is a testament to the beauty of patience, friendship, and the power of commitment. 
To Intan Ayu, you are my partner, my confidante, and my greatest love. I can't wait to create countless more memories together, from this Ramadan to the next and beyond.

Thank you for being a part of our journey, dear readers. May you find love and happiness in your own stories, just as we have in ours.
